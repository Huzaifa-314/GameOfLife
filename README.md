# Conway's Game of Life  

An interactive implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** built using **JavaFX**. This project demonstrates the principles of cellular automata, where complex patterns emerge from simple rules. The application provides a dynamic and engaging interface to explore, create, and simulate the Game of Life.

## üìö What is Conway's Game of Life?  

Conway's Game of Life, created by mathematician John Horton Conway, is a zero-player game consisting of a grid of cells. Each cell has two states: alive or dead. The game's evolution is determined by these four rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).  
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.  
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).  
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).

## üéÆ Features  

- **Interactive Grid Drawing**: Click and drag to toggle cells between alive and dead states.  
- **Simulation Controls**: Start, pause, and reset the simulation.  
- **Zoom and Pan**: Explore large grids with smooth zooming and panning.  
- **Customizable Patterns**: Draw or recreate classic patterns like gliders, oscillators, and still lifes.
